Make Use command correctly change currentDatabase
Only check files if the current database is not already set to the incoming database

For select statement get number of brackets

Add get column id function to use with select

change jsql to jrsql


Add each element to a list, pick out each element based on order of bracket array i.e.
element[bracketArray[i]] = etc



Bugs -
No ' ' messes up search


Alter add
Gets table and adds in attribute (attribute name) to table

Alter remove
Delete the column in table->columns
Delete the element in entries[i]

INSERT
Giving wrong number of attributes return error

UPDATE
make updateTable() more efficient (not loop throguh each keys - instead loop until reach one)

WHERE
Add support for boolean operators
